        <h2>Hi, my name is Ofor, Uchenna.</h2>
        <p>
            I am a final year student from the department of Agric and Bioresources Engineering at FUTO (Federal University of Technology, Owerri). I am a creative thinker, someone curious to know the 'WHY', rather than just the 'WHAT'. I am someone that is not afraid to take up challenges, rather attempts to give my best no matter what. <br>
            I started my coding journey late last year (2021), in which i bought an online course and learnt the basics of HTML and CSS. Due to the Christmas festivities, it was halted and i began in earnest early weeks of January. <br>I was very new to the coding world, as i had no prior knowledge whatsoever. As such, learning on my own proved
            to be a very tedious and frustrating venture. Luckily i had a friend, who was also in the learning stages, so all we had were ourselves for moral support. As I progressed, I got enligtened on the benefits of belonging to communities. Most especially, the challenge, push and support they bring. I thought this would be much of a hassle, but in the 
            long run, it is the best decision i made so far. And what more, belonging to an organized, student-centered community like the Zuri x I4G Program, amongst others.
            <br>I am currently on my way to becoming a Fullstack web-developer and by Gods grace, I will get there.

                My Priorities are nothing short of making my goals a reality. And these goals are simply ways i can make a cutting edge impact to the society around me, the world at large, as well as my account balance, using the innovative ideas, network and knowledge acquired along the way.            </p>
